									<h2><a href="https://public.tableau.com/authoring/Covid-19AfricaImpactVisualization/Dashboard1#1">Data Visualization In Tableau<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>My mother recently came back from a trip to our home country, Cameroon. Based on her encounter with COVID-19 here in the United States(US), she explained that though cases of the virus have been surging in the past, people there, compared to us here in the US, are now finding more ways to stay protected and alive. As a result, this has decreased deaths counts. I wanted to validate this information and get a more accurate perspective on the situation in my home country and throughout the continent of Africa. What I discovered through this visualization touched me and validated professional data and my prior belief that nowhere is safe from this virus     </p>

										<h2><a href="#">More About Me, my Mission, and Values <br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ProfessionalPhoto.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In college, I enjoyed working with cell cultures, extracting DNA, performing gram stains, and even working as a research biologist. However, like many college students, I was still unsure about my future career. Between staring down into microscopes and presenting my results, I found my passion; analyzing the data. Pressing down on this passion, I decided to venture away from the laboratory and pick up an internship in healthcare where I felt a stronger calling for data analysis and administrative tasks. Though my experience with VITAS Healthcare offers me countless opportunities as an administrator, it does not emphasize databases or programming languages. I realized it is essential to create data from multiple programming platforms. I decided to learn programming languages some months ago, and I have not been disappointed. I started with SQL, then transitioned into R, then Tableau, and so on. I invested in certificates and fast-tracked my learning experience through professional teachings offered through Coursera and Udemy. I have gained experience collecting, transforming, and organizing data for analysis to help make informed decisions while building my communication, organization, and analytical skills. My mission is to work as part of a team to bring clarity and demystify the multi-dimensional aspects of healthcare through data analysis. I want to use my knowledge of programming tools to create, analyze, and present data in the technology and healthcare industry. As an immigrant, I value diversity and respect in my work environment. Most people can be taught work skills. However, it is impossible to work within an environment where one feels insignificant, downplayed, and disrespected. I am open to working as a full-time, part-time, temporary, and or seasonal employee within the Washington DC-Baltimore area and even beyond!      </p>
